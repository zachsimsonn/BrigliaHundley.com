The previous AI engineer began by assessing the Briglia Hundley website's deployability, confirming its functionality. The user then raised issues concerning an outdated sitemap, incorrect logo, and mobile responsiveness. The engineer systematically addressed these, updating logo references and implementing mobile optimizations, though initial attempts at sitemap and logo fixes faced persistent issues. A crucial turning point was the  diagnosing a   setting issue, which was then resolved. Subsequently, the focus shifted to SEO, where the engineer, upon user feedback, recognized that URL redirects were detrimental and began implementing dedicated SEO-optimized landing pages. However, this introduced a significant React Router routing problem, where the new pages fail to render, a core issue remaining unresolved at the trajectory's end. The engineer has diligently followed user instructions, even when they caused setbacks, and has used available tools to diagnose and fix problems, demonstrating a methodical but iterative approach.

The user initially requested assistance in deploying the Briglia Hundley law firm website, which was an existing, fully functional application.
The primary problem to be solved evolved from deployment into several critical updates and SEO enhancements:
1.  **Sitemap Update:** The sitemap () needed to be updated to a newer, comprehensive version with significantly more URLs (initially 700 lines more, later refined to 800+ additional location and practice area combinations) to enhance SEO.
2.  **Logo Correction:** The current website logo was incorrect; it needed to be replaced with a specific, newly provided image ().
3.  **Testimonial Functionality:** Ensure client testimonials were clickable (later confirmed to be working).
4.  **Mobile Optimization:** The website was not optimized for mobile devices; the main video was distorted, and links were non-functional. All elements needed responsive adjustments.
5.  **SEO Enhancement (Beyond Sitemap):** Critically, the user emphasized deep SEO optimization to rank highly for location + practice area searches (e.g., Tysons Corner Criminal Defense Lawyer). This evolved into a requirement for unique, content-rich landing pages for each combination, replacing initial URL redirects which were identified as SEO detrimental.
The application currently features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. It has integrated SEO features and performance optimizations.

-   **Full-stack Application Development**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Deployment & Environment**: Kubernetes Container, Supervisor (process manager), environment variables ().
-   **Frontend Technologies**: React Router (for navigation), Tailwind CSS (for styling), Axios (for API calls), React Helmet Async (for SEO metadata).
-   **SEO**: Sitemaps (), Local SEO (location-specific content, schema markup), structured data.
-   **Troubleshooting**: Use of  for complex issues, bash commands for file system and process management.

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/frontend/public/sitemap.xml**: This file contains the XML sitemap for SEO, listing all discoverable URLs on the website.
    -   **Changes**: The file was initially 912 lines, then fully replaced with a 1,248-line, comprehensive SEO-optimized version provided by the user, including extensive location and practice area combinations. It was briefly deleted during troubleshooting and restored.
-   **/app/frontend/src/data/mockData.js**: Contains mocked data for the frontend, including website content, SEO details, and potentially logo references.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to reference the new logo file ().
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Testimonials.jsx**: Displays client testimonials.
    -   **Changes**: No functional changes were made; the component was confirmed to be working as per user's requirements (clickable links).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx**: The main hero section of the landing page, containing the large video.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to fix video sizing issues (removed viewport units, now uses percentage-based scaling) and ensure hero buttons use proper React Router Links.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**: The website's navigation header.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed mobile navigation issues by replacing  handlers with React Router Links and ensured the mobile logo also uses React Router for navigation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/pages/SitemapPage.jsx**: Displays the clickable sitemap links on the website.
    -   **Changes**: Initially, 20 new location-based URLs were added. Subsequently, over 100 more clickable links for various location + practice area combinations were added, and their styling was adjusted (smaller padding, icon, text size).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/pages/LocationPracticeAreaPage.jsx**: Intended to be the unique landing page for each location + practice area combination.
    -   **Changes**: The file was created/overwritten to include SEO-optimized content, local schema markup, and dynamic content based on  and  props, replacing previous redirect logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main application file, responsible for React Router configuration and overall structure.
    -   **Changes**: Initial routing for generic pages. Later, redirect routes for location-specific URLs were added, then critically *removed* when direct SEO landing pages were adopted. The primary issue at the end of the trajectory involves the correct implementation and precedence of routes for . Imports for  and other components were also adjusted.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/LocationPageRouter.jsx**: A new component created to handle the dynamic routing logic for the vast number of location-practice area pages.
    -   **Changes**: Created to parse URL parameters and render the  with appropriate props. It has undergone multiple revisions to try and resolve routing issues.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Contains project metadata and script definitions for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: The  setting was removed to resolve issues with static file serving (logo, sitemap) being incorrectly routed through GitHub Pages path.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Logo Issue**: The user explicitly stated it should look like this (referencing an image) and that the current  does not match, implying a new logo file needs to be provided and uploaded by the user.
-   **Routing for SEO Landing Pages**: The newly implemented SEO-optimized  is not being rendered correctly due to persistent React Router issues in  and . The links open to a default page.
-   **Sitemap Completeness**: While URLs have been added in batches, the user initially requested ~1000 additional URLs, and the process is ongoing.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work being undertaken is troubleshooting and resolving the React Router issues that are preventing the newly created SEO-optimized landing pages from rendering. The previous AI engineer has:
1.  Identified that the website's default HTML is being served for URLs like , indicating a routing mismatch.
2.  Created  to dynamically handle these routes, parsing location and practice area from the URL.
3.  Modified  to include the  and remove previous redirect logic.
4.  Attempted various fixes in  and , including:
    *   Adjusting import statements (, ).
    *   Resolving variable name conflicts (e.g.,  in ).
    *   Experimenting with route order and specificity in  to ensure the dynamic route takes precedence.
    *   Simplifying test cases to isolate the routing problem.
5.  Confirmed no JavaScript errors in the frontend logs, pointing purely to a routing configuration issue.
Despite these efforts, the problem persists, and the dynamic pages are not loading as expected.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue debugging the React Router configuration in  and  to ensure the dynamic SEO landing pages are correctly matched and rendered.
