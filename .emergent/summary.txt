The previous AI engineer meticulously progressed through multiple iterations of feature implementation and bug fixing for a Briglia Hundley law firm website. The process involved understanding initial requirements, systematically addressing visual and functional issues, and refining the UI based on continuous user feedback. Key phases included fixing broken image links, standardizing URL formats, overhauling the About Us page, and enhancing attorney profiles with dynamic content and award badges. The engineer also tackled deployment challenges related to GitHub Pages and internal build environments, demonstrating persistence in debugging React and ESLint compatibility issues. The work concludes with the engineer actively troubleshooting a build failure related to React's  hook and dependency conflicts, indicating a complex technical challenge that requires further attention.

The user tasked the AI engineer with a comprehensive overhaul and bug fix for an existing Briglia Hundley law firm website, which was initially deemed professional but required significant refinements. The core problem was a series of visual inconsistencies, broken links, and outdated content, hindering the professional image of the firm.

Specific requirements included:
- **Image Fixes**: Correcting broken image links for Accountants Liability and Securities Litigation, Criminal Law, and Trusts and Estate Planning (especially on the homepage). Ensuring all blog images are law-related, removing non-legal images like a monkey picture.
- **URL Formatting**: Standardizing practice area URLs to  and attorney URLs to .
- **Header Adjustments**: Making attorney header banners slightly smaller, ensuring law-related images, and removing blank/ocean stock images. Refining Our Firm header size, title (Our Firm vs The Firm), subtitle removal, brightness, and making it match Our Practice Areas header. Ensuring Our Attorneys and Resources (later Blogs) pages also use the same courthouse background header.
- **About Us Page Overhaul (The Firm page)**:
    - Adding professional images for 6 staff members (Amanda Moellendick, Carmen Escalera, Abbi Marsh, Nini Daker, Terence Bowles, Jacob Rimland), with specific image URLs, making them square and 3x larger.
    - Replacing a highlights grid with a specific building image.
    - Changing the background to dark navy blue, then to white, and text to grey.
    - Removing specific marketing text Our practice features prominent...AV rating from the staff section.
    - Updating location text from Tysons Corner, Fairfax County, Virginia to Tysons Corner, Virginia, and another instance from Tysons Corner, Virginia to Fairfax, Virginia.
    - Adding a The Firm (later Our Firm) header.
    - Adding an Announcements section featuring 3 latest LinkedIn posts (later removed).
    - Adding an Our Recognition section with award images and backlinks (later removed due to broken images).
- **Attorney Profile Details**:
    - Expanding Lauren L. Gill's summary from one sentence to three.
    - Implementing a more button for attorney descriptions (max 4 lines, then 3 lines) similar to testimonials, with bold grey text.
    - Changing Kaley Duncan Ward's title to Senior Associate.
    - Adding award badges (Best Lawyers, Super Lawyers, Martindale-Hubbell AV Rating) to individual attorney pages for James, Steve, Brian, and Amy.
    - Removing the Practice Areas section from individual attorney profiles.
- **Functional Improvements**: Ensuring all Call and Schedule Consultation buttons are functional and visible, redirecting to the correct numbers/contact page.
- **Blog Section**: Renaming Resources to Blogs throughout the site (menu, header, section titles). Correcting blog authors (e.g., Arrested at a protest by Raymond, Crawford v. Washington by Raymond). Crawling and adding all missing blog posts (7 pages) from the Briglia Hundley website.
- **Homepage Text**: Ensuring the About Briglia HundleyÂ® section on the homepage retains white font despite other About page changes.
- **Deployment & Stability**: Ensuring the application compiles and deploys successfully to GitHub Pages and emergent preview environments, troubleshooting white screen issues and build errors.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Frontend Technologies**: React.js, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Router for navigation.
- **Backend Technologies**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (local/Atlas).
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for service management, GitHub Pages for frontend deployment, Emergent deployments for full-stack.
- **State Management**: Local React state (e.g.,  for  logic).
- **Data Handling**:  for frontend content,  for backend environment variables.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes, inline styles for dynamic adjustments.
- **URL Management**:  from ,  vs  for routing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**High-Level Architecture:**
- : Contains the FastAPI application, handling API requests and database interactions.
- : Contains the React application, responsible for the user interface and interactions with the backend.
- : Dedicated for testing.
- : Contains utility scripts.
- : Used for tracking problem statements and testing data.
- : Project documentation.

<pending_tasks>
- **Remaining Blog Posts**: Although many blog posts were added, the task to add *all* 7 pages of blog posts from the original website by crawling systematically was initiated but not explicitly confirmed as fully completed.
- **Clarify Williams Attorney**: The user requested Crawford v. Washington to be by Williams, but no attorney named Williams was found. This requires user clarification.
- **Deployment to GitHub Pages**: The persistent issues with GitHub Pages deployment (white screen, build failures) indicate that a fully successful, user-deployable GitHub Pages setup is still pending. The AI engineer provided manual steps, implying the direct in-environment deployment was not fully resolved.

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary request was focused on resolving critical deployment issues. The user reported that the emergent preview is showing compiled with problems, and the github pages is down.

The AI engineer's current work involves:
1.  **Diagnosing Build Errors**: Specifically tackling the  error during the  process.
2.  **Troubleshooting ESLint and Dependency Conflicts**: Addressing warnings and errors related to , , and  unmet peer dependencies.
3.  **Investigating React Compatibility**: Looking into issues where React's  hook or  import might be causing problems, possibly due to version mismatches or incorrect usage within the codebase or its dependencies.
4.  **Implementing Fixes**: The engineer has attempted several fixes, including:
    *   Removing  to resolve conflicts ().
    *   Removing problematic ESLint dependencies (yarn remove v1.22.22
[1/4] Removing module eslint-loader...
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/remove for documentation about this command.).
    *   Modifying  by removing the  directive.
    *   Adjusting  imports.
    *   Toggling  and  in  to try and find a working configuration for both local preview and GitHub Pages.
    *   Attempting to use  directly.
    *   Adding  file (though not directly used in the current problem).
5.  **Verifying Preview Stability**: The emergent preview was successfully restored to a working state, confirming that the local development environment is stable and reflects all previous changes.
6.  **Addressing GitHub Pages Discrepancy**: The core issue of GitHub Pages showing a white screen after deployment persists, indicating a problem with the production build or deployment configuration for that specific environment, even if the local preview works.

The last action taken was **Step 10: Downgrade React Router to a compatible version**, indicating the engineer believes the  version is causing the  hook import error during the build process, and is about to perform this dependency downgrade.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Downgrade the  package to a version compatible with the current React environment to resolve the  hook import error.
