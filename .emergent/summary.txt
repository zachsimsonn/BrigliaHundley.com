The previous AI engineer diligently addressed a wide range of issues for the Briglia Hundley law firm website, spanning content updates, UI refinements, routing fixes, and critical deployment troubleshooting. The work commenced with resolving a persistent page not found error for practice areas, stemming from an  routing conflict. This led to a broader investigation into  vs  compatibility across different deployment environments (GitHub Pages, GoDaddy, Emergent), necessitating repeated router switches and  file creation. A major part of the work involved updating footer and sitemap components, initially causing a temporary loss of SEO-critical location pages, which were subsequently restored. Extensive content updates for numerous practice areas (Accountants Liability, Appellate, Business, Community, Corporate, Criminal, Employment, Family, Municipal) were performed, fixing raw HTML rendering and button alignments. The engineer also replaced inappropriate blog images with professional law-related ones. The trajectory concludes with the engineer having just updated the content for the last set of practice areas and is about to test them.
